Chapter 1 â€“ The Machine Learning landscape

This notebook contains the code examples in chapter 1. You'll also find the exercise solutions at the end of the notebook. The rest of this notebook is used to generate lifesat.csv from the original data sources, and some of this chapter's figures.

You're welcome to go through the code in this notebook if you want, but the real action starts in the next chapter.
